#### How it was built

1. Built locally on a computer establishing the DB and building out a function server.
2. Create the fields utilizing the grid funciton. 
3. Identify what functions would be utilized. 
4. Make sure it all works 

#### My favorite part

My favorite part was the edit feature, having a bit of trouble with it at first made the end result all the worthy.
